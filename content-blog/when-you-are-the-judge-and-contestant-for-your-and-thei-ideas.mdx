## 1. When Your Idea Joins the Thunderdome

- One moment you’re brainstorming, the next—your idea is in a head-to-head with someone else’s.
- Suddenly, you’re asking yourself if speaking up is helpful or just… self-promoting.
- You want the best decision for the team—but also kind of want to win.
- Staying quiet feels wrong, but talking too much feels... suspicious.
- Welcome to the logic vs. ego showdown.

## 2. The Bias Boomerang

- You try to offer feedback, but second-guess every word before it leaves your mouth.
- Even saying “I think both ideas have merit” feels like a Jedi mind trick.
- After the meeting, your brain turns into a courtroom replaying everything you said.
- The fear of *appearing* biased becomes its own source of bias.
- Fun twist: most of the team wasn’t even paying that much attention to your tone.

## 3. The Tightrope of Fairness

- You want to be objective—but you also worked really hard on your idea.
- Being silent feels dishonest; being vocal feels risky.
- There's no clear manual for “how hard is too hard to push?”
- You overcorrect to the point of underselling your thoughts.
- Still, you'd rather lean too fair than be seen as the office bulldozer.

## 4. Self-Doubt: The Surprise Meeting Invite

- Even after giving well-meant feedback, your brain pings you hours later: *Was that too much?*
- You start wondering if your silence would’ve been more supportive.
- It’s the emotional version of a software bug: “worked fine during the meeting, crashed later in reflection.”
- You wonder if your credibility took a hit—even if no one said a word.
- Self-doubt walks in like it owns the place... again.

## 5. Growth Is a Weird, Noisy Process

- Realizing you're worried about being biased means you're probably not acting biased.
- Growth isn't about never being wrong—it’s about being willing to question your thinking.
- You learn to separate passion for the idea from attachment to being right.
- Feedback becomes less about ego, more about impact.
- Some days it’s messy, but it means you care.

## 6. Mental Notes for Next Time

- Evaluate ideas on their merits before looking at who suggested them.
- Trust that your team can spot the difference between advocacy and arrogance.
- Invite others to weigh in, even when you feel strongly—especially then.
- Don’t let the fear of being “too loud” silence valuable input.
- Remember: true fairness isn’t about muting yourself—it’s about listening fully and speaking clearly.

## Final Thought

- It’s okay to care. It’s okay to advocate. And it’s okay to overthink a little.
- What matters most is your intent and your willingness to stay open—even when your idea’s on the line.
- If you're questioning your fairness, you're already doing the inner work that good collaborators do.
