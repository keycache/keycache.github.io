## Introduction
- Takes raw notes, chats, or markdown and makes a casual multi-voice conversation.
- Outputs clean JSON thatâ€™s ready for TTS or voice cloning.
- Lets you pick how many speakers and spreads lines naturally.
- Uses Kitten TTS to synthesize lightweight audio.

## How it works
- Feed text via file or stdin. The agent builds a focused dialogue.
- CLI lets you set participant count and paths for input and output.
- Produces structured JSON so audio can be generated reliably.
- Kitten TTS renders a single WAV from the JSON conversation.

## Quick start
- Run: python agent.py --participant-count 2
- Optional text: --text-path data/test_data.txt
- Optional audio: --target-audio-path .data/audio/out.wav
- Swap counts or paths to fit your workflow.

## What you can build now
- Turn long AI chats into a short panel talk.
- Convert meeting notes into a two-host recap.
- Make a study guide episode from markdown.
- Prototype multi-voice narration for a demo.

## Roadmap and questions
- Do we want speaker profiles with stable voice IDs in the JSON.
- Should we chunk very long inputs and stitch segments for smooth flow.
- Do we need a seed flag for reproducible dialogue order and timing.
- Should we stream audio per turn instead of one final WAV.
- Are we enforcing simple punctuation cleanup before TTS for clarity.
